Please analyze the implement Task/Issue: $ARGUMENTS

Follow these steps
1. Always pull from main and create a new branch for the changes
2. Create a new PR for each Task/Issue
3. The PR should contain proper description and execution outputs
4. Do not implement anything else except the one specified in the task/issue
5. Try to create a PR with less than 500 lines of changes if possible. Exemptions allowed when bootstrapping and creating a boilerplate.
6. Build, test and run linter before pushing to github
7. After pushing or opening PR, check for github checks to finish. If it fails, use aws cli to find the actual error and keep fixing it
8. Create a task list of all these actions and ensure that they are all completed before claiming completion.

Remember to use the GitHub CLI (`gh`) for all GitHub-related tasks.
