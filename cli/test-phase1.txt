Phase 1 Test: Correlation ID Simplification

This is a test document to validate that the simplified correlation ID system is working correctly after our refactoring:

- Removed 7 unused functions (156 lines of dead code)
- Eliminated global state from structured logger  
- Reduced correlation.ts from 222 to 81 lines (63% reduction)
- All Lambda functions now use explicit correlation passing

The correlation ID should be properly tracked through the upload → processing → analysis pipeline.
